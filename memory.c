 * Algorithm
 * ---------
 * This allocator is based on "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth.
 * The algorithm itself is described in :
 *  - Volume 1 - Fundamental Algorithms
 *    - Chapter 2 â€“ Information Structures
 *      - 2.5 Dynamic Storage
 *        - Algorithm A (First-fit method)
 *        - Algorithm C (Liberation with boundary tags)
 *
 * The point of a memory allocator is to manage memory in terms of allocation
 * and liberation requests. Allocation finds and reserves memory for a user,
 * whereas liberation makes that memory available again for future allocations.
 * Memory is not created, it must be available from the start, and the allocator
 * simply tracks its usage with metadata, allocated from memory itself.
 *
 * Data structures
 * ---------------
 * Here is a somewhat graphical representation of how memory is organized in
 * this implementation :
 *
 *   allocated block              free block
 * +------+-----------------+   +------+-----------------+
 * | size | allocation flag |   | size | allocation flag | <- header boundary
 * +------+-----------------+   +------+-----------------+    tag
 * |                        |   | free list node (prev   | <- payload or
 * .       payload          .   | and next pointers)     |    free list node
 * .                        .   +------------------------+
 * .                        .   .                        .
 * .                        .   .                        .
 * .                        .   .                        .
 * +------+-----------------+   +------+-----------------+
 * | size | allocation flag |   | size | allocation flag | <- footer boundary
 * +------+-----------------+   +------+-----------------+    tag
 *
 * Here is a view of multiple contiguous blocks :
 *
 * +------+-----------------+ <--+
 * | size | allocation flag |    |
 * +------+-----------------+    +- single block
 * |                        |    |
 * .       payload          .    |
 * .                        .    |
 * .                        .    |
 * +------+-----------------+    |
 * | size | allocation flag |    |
 * +------+-----------------+ <--+
 * +------+-----------------+
 * | size | allocation flag |
 * +------+-----------------+
 * |                        |
 * .       payload          .
 * .                        .
 * .                        .
 * +------+-----------------+
 * | size | allocation flag |
 * +------+-----------------+
 * +------+-----------------+
 * | size | allocation flag |
 * +------+-----------------+
 * |                        |
 * .       payload          .
 * .                        .
 * .                        .
 * +------+-----------------+
 * | size | allocation flag |
 * +------+-----------------+
 *
 * The reason for the footer boundary tag is merging on liberation. When
 * called, the mem_free() function is given a pointer to a payload. Since
 * the size of a boundary tag is fixed, the address of the whole block
 * can easily be computed. In order to reduce fragmentation, i.e. a state
 * where all free blocks are small and prevent allocating bigger blocks,
 * the allocator attempts to merge neighbor free blocks. Obtaining the
 * address of the next block is easily achieved by simply adding the size
 * of the current block, stored in the boundary tag, to the address of
 * the block. But without a footer boundary tag, finding the address of
 * the previous block is computationally expensive.
 *
 * Alignment
 * ---------
 * The word "aligned" and references to "alignment" in general can be
 * found throughout the documentation of this module. Alignment is a
 * property of a value, usually an address, to be a multiple of a size.
 * This value is said to be "size-byte aligned", or "aligned on a size
 * byte boundary". Common sizes include the processor word or cache line
 * sizes. For example, the x86 architecture is 32-bits, making the word
 * size 4 bytes. Addresses such as 0, 4, 8, 12, 512 and 516 are 4-byte
 * aligned, whereas 1, 2, 3, 511, 513, 514 and 515 aren't.
 *
 *
 * Pointers
 * --------
 * The code in this module makes extensive use of pointer arithmetic and
 * conversion between pointer types. It's important to keep in mind that,
 * in C, the void pointer is meant as a generic reference to objects of
 * any type. As a result, any pointer can be assigned to a void pointer
 * without explicit casting, and a void pointer may be assigned to any
 * pointer as well.

     * adding 1 means pointing to the next element. A good way to remember

     * (6.5.3.4 The sizeof operator).

     * As a side note, a GNU extension allows using pointer arithmetic on
     * void pointers, where the "size of void" is 1, turning pointer
     * arithmetic on void pointers into byte arithmetic, allowing this
     * expression to be written as :
